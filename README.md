Description:  If users want to travel somehwhere but have no idea where to start, using this app would be helpful to them. On the homescreen, they are given travelling ideas; upon selection, they are directed to that certain country with a short description. If interested, they can choose to furthur explore and see hotel recommendations. If not, they can return to the homescreen and see if there is another place that interests them.								

Updates: 2018
Nov 9 - Developed the idea of having the travelling app. Laid out the four countries that the users can choose from. Brainstormed what the user interface would lead to different pages.
Nov 13 - Had more layouts that is connected to the main home screen (the countries) as well as more view controllers. Added in hotel information such as price, location, etc.
Nov 16 - n/a
Nov 28 - Added in more pictures and connecting them with layouts. Also researched more travel tips.
Nov 30 - I added in backgrounds and more images, as well as hotel recommendations. I also worked on the layouts and how each connects to others.
Dec 4 - There's an issue with the centering the images. I was trying to figure out and tested the functionality of the app.
Dec 6 - I did peer review with Yubin and she suggested that there are limited resources. I will work on that more and possibly add in outside-recommendations.

Review:
I think the app is really cool. Though there are limited choices of countries and hotels, I still thought that the app was pretty good because it was user friendly. Most of the hotel recommendation apps are very complicated to use or requires login or email info, but her app did not require those things. As a user, it was very convinient to use. Without any explanation, I could easily find out how the app worked because of the clear instructions within the app.
